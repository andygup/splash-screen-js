# splash-screen-js

Easy to use JavaScript splash screen this is 100% framework agnostic. You don't need Angular, Ember, jQuery, React, Polymer, Bootstrap, etc. It's just good old CSS3 and JavaScript...seriously. Just bolt it into an existing app, tweak it to your needs and then hit the gas.

Many thanks to the inspiration from [@ihatetomatoes](https://ihatetomatoes.net/create-custom-preloading-screen/).
